Email Spammer using Selenium

This program is subject to bugs. Due to the nature of Gmail, the xPath and other HTML element identifiers change when logging into Gmail. This makes it difficult to locate which HTML element corresponds to which process throughout the algorithm. Spam.py is a first early prototype of an email spammer based off of a password brute forcer using selenium. SpamVer2.py is the second version with edits to try to attempt to execute on different google generated xpath element ids. However, even with a certain range of generated xpath ids, it still would sometimes encounter errors such as not finding the xpath ids to execute tasks like composing a email message. 

Status: Encountered Errors/Bugs

# Instructions
Download SpamVer2.py or Spam.py and the selenium library. Selelnium is included in this repository. Run the program using python [file name].py.
